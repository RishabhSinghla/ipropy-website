/**
 * Make a commit say which developer's Claude made it.
 *
 * Two people work on this repo (and on the CRM, which has the same file), each from their own Claude Code account, and
 * every session committed as `Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` — so GitHub's
 * commit list, the deployments page and `git log` all read `claude` for both
 * of them. Nobody could tell whose change went to production, which is the
 * question you actually ask when something breaks.
 *
 * Claude Code hands every session the signed-in account's address in
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_USER_EMAIL`. That is the one thing that genuinely differs
 * between the two of them, so it is what this reads.
 *
 * It sets the identity **repo-locally** (`.git/config`, which is not
 * committed) rather than globally: this is the only repo two accounts share,
 * and a global change would follow a session into somebody else's work.
 *
 * Two things decided on purpose:
 *
 *  * **The GitHub "Verified" tick is given up, knowingly.** That badge checks
 *    the *committer* against the key that signed the commit, and these are
 *    SSH-signed by the Claude account's key. Measured both ways on
 *    20 September 2026: changing the author alone keeps `verified: true` and
 *    still links the commit to the developer's own account — but git has no
 *    `committer.name` config key, so splitting author from committer needs
 *    `GIT_COMMITTER_*` in the environment, and the shells this tool runs are
 *    non-interactive and source no profile. There is nowhere to put it that
 *    every commit would read. A name that is always right beat a tick that
 *    appears only when somebody remembers a prefix, and `main` does not
 *    require signed commits, so nothing breaks. Both, on one commit:
 *    `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=Claude GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=noreply@anthropic.com git commit …`
 *  * **Nothing is guessed.** An account not in the table below still gets a
 *    distinct name, derived from its address, rather than a wrong one. A
 *    commit attributed to the wrong person is worse than one attributed to an
 *    email.
